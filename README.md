   - Jest
   - Testing Library

## Section 2: Using redux-saga-test-plan

### 5. Introduction to Testing Redux Sagas

#### Testing Implementation Details

1. Testing Sagas is testing implementation details
   - Not testing app the way a user would
   - Testing code, not app behavior
2. Good idea for complicated sagas
   - redux-saga is known for testability
   - "Testing implementation" tradeoffs:
     - diagnosis is easier; test maintenance is harder
   - Help diagnose behavior-based("functional") tests
3. These tests are not for behavioral testing purists

#### Three Saga Sections

1. This section: intro to redux-saga-test-plan syntax
2. Next section: complex _ticketFlow_ saga
   - controlled by _takeEvery_
3. Last section: _signInFlow_ saga with fork
   - controlled by infinite _while_ loop

### 6. Introduction to redux-saga-test-plan

- [Several options for saga test libraries](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/advanced/Testing/)
- [redux-saga-test-plan doc](https://redux-saga-test-plan.jeremyfairbank.com/)
- Integration testing
  - run the saga as a whole
  - assert on effects (e.g. put or call)
- Unit testing
  - run the saga step-by-step
  - assert on effects AND order
- We will mostly integration testing in this course
  - unit tests for fork cancel, not possible in integration

> I've decided to go the "Redux Saga" part through once more

## Complete React Developer - Redux Saga

### 195. Generator Functions

```js
function* genC(i) {
  yield i;
  yield i + 10;
  return 25;
}
const gB = gen(5);
gB.next();
// { value: 5, done: false }
gB.next();
// { value: 15, done: false }
gB.next();
// { value: 25, done: true }
```

> Thinking of it as: \
> Ability to "pause" functions

### 197. redux-saga

```sh
npm install --save redux-saga
```

### 198. Redux Thunk Into Saga

```js
// shop.sagas.js
import { take, takeEvery, takeLatest, delay, put } from "redux-saga/effects";

export function* onIncrement() {
  yield console.log("I am incremented");
  yield delay(3000); // it doesn't block next event of onIncrement()
  yield put({ type: "INCREMENT_FROM_SAGA" });
}

export function* incrementSagaTakeEvery() {
  yield takeEvery("INCREMENT", onIncrement);
}

/** takeLatest
 * with many click event,
 * onIncrement will be fired, but if new event occurs before onIncrement finishes,
 * it takes only the last event
 */
export function* incrementSagaTakeLatest() {
  yield takeLatest("INCREMENT", onIncrement);
}

/* take with while
 * This looks similar with takeEvery
 * But it is hung on delay(), unlike takeEvery which creates new
 */
export function* incrementSagaTakeWhile() {
  while (true) {
    yield take("INCREMENT");
    yield console.log("I am incremented");
    yield delay(5000);
  }
}

/** take */
export function* incrementSagaTake() {
  yield take("INCREMENT");
  console.log("I am incremented");
}
```

### 200. Root Saga

```js
// root-saga.js
import { all, call } from "redux-saga/effects";
import { fetchCollectionsStart } from "./shop/shop.sagas";

export default function* rootSaga() {
  // all : https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#alleffects---parallel-effects
  yield all([call(fetchCollectionsStart)]);
}
```

---

### 10. Partial Assertions

[redux-saga-test-plan : Partial Assertions - Helper Methods](https://redux-saga-test-plan.jeremyfairbank.com/integration-testing/partial-matching.html)

### 11. Review: redux-saga-test-plan Introduction

- Integration testing (We will do mostly integration testing)
  - Run entire saga
  - Tools like mocks and partial matchers
- Unit testing (It will be introduced at the end of this course)
  - Run saga step-by-step
  - Assert on effects AND order
- _redux-saga-test-plan_ syntax
  - _return / await expectSaga_
  - _[.not].effect()_ for assertions
  - Partial assertions, such as _.call.fn()_
  - _.run()_ for running the saga

### 14. Error from not Returning `expectSaga`

```js
expectSaga(ticketFlow, holdAction);
return expectSaga(ticketFlow, holdAction);
```

What happens if you don't return? -> It will always pass (=fault positive)

- Without return expectSaga() or await expectSaga()
- Test function starts async expectSaga call
  - Exits before promise resolves
- Assertions run after promise resolves
  - After test has already passed

test function starts -> async call -> test function complets without error -> promise resolves -> assertions run

### 15. Mocking with `.provide()` method

_provide()_ Syntax

- Static vs. dynamic
  - static: array of tuples _[matcher, mock value]_
  - dynamic: object liternal, _{ matcher: (effect, next) => {} }_
- We will be using mostly static
  - Dynamic: _race_ isn't available for static, making an effect take longer
- Matchers: https://redux-saga-test-plan.jeremyfairbank.com/integration-testing/mocking/static-providers.html

### 20. Code Quiz! Purchase Error

- Pass _ticketFlow_ to _expectSaga_
- Mock similar to last error thrown test (network providers, selector, override)
- Provider that throws error, use _matchers.call.like_:
  ```js
  matchers.call.like({
    fn: reserveTicketServerCall,
    args: [purchaseReservation], // not holdReservation!
  });
  ```
- Dispatch this action to trigger _purchaseTickets_ saga:
  `startTicketPurchase(purchasePayload)`
- Assertions similar to last error thrown test

### 23. OPTIONAL Code Quiz! Successful Purchase

- All of these effects happen in _purchaseTicket_ saga
  - Plus assert on _cancelSource.cancel_ call from _cancelSource_ argument
- No need for _race()_ provider here (just let the purchase win)
- Provide all network mocks
- Approaches
  - Use previous tests as a guide, or
  - More challenging: write without looking at previous tests
  - Strong recommendation against copy/paste

### 24. OPTIONAL Code Quiz! Hold Cancel

Technical Notes

- Dispatch this action for "cancel":
  - `startTicketRelease({ reservation: holdReservation, reason: "test" })`
- Dispatch this action for "abort":
  - `startTicketAbort({ reservation: holdReservation, reason: "test" })`
- Cancellation toast will look like this:
  - `startToast({ title: "test", status: "warning" })`

### 25. Parametrization with 'test.each()'

test.each([argument object]) (test name, test function)

### 26. Review: Complex takeEvery Saga Tests

- more _redux-saga-test-plan_ syntax
  - _.provide()_ for mocking
    - _throwError()_ value for throwing Error
  - _.dispatch()_ for dispatching actions after start
  - dynamic provider for _race_ effect
- jest's _test.each()_ for parametrizing tests

### 27. Introduction to Sign In Sagas

- Watcher: _while_ loop with cancel-able _fork_
  - cancel sign in if user navigates away from server returns
- Slice manages _status_ piece of state (values: _idle_, _pending_)
- Saga only manages sign in
  - sign out doesn't have cancellation controls
- Sign-in vs Sign-up

### 28. Set Up signInSaga Test File

test.todo()\
`test.todo('successful sign-in');`

### 29. Testing Successful Sign-in: .silentRun and Timeout

There will be a warning message because signInFlow() has infinite loop.

```sh
console.warn
    [WARNING]: Saga exceeded async timeout of 25ms
```

Not to see this error, use `silentRun()` instead of `run()`

### 31. Code Quiz! Sign Up Flow

- Virtually identical to sign in flow
  - only difference: payload to _signInRequest_
  - actual code path diverges in call to the server
- Worth including the test?
  - probably not as a saga test
  - maybe in e2e testing, check that the user was created

### 32. Integration Test for Canceled Fork

```js
// as we have mock provider, authenticateUser completed almost immediately.
.fork(authenticateUser, signInRequestPayload)
// and cancelSignIn() didn't dispatch
.dispatch(cancelSignIn())
```

Give it 500ms delay

```js
const sleep = (delay: number) =>
  new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));

.provide({s
  call: async (effect, next) => {
    if (effect.fn === authServerCall) {
      await sleep(500);
    }
    next();
  },
})
```

### 34. Introduction to redux-saga-test-plan Unit Tests

Asserting on _cancel_ Effect

- How to assert a cancel occurred?
- _cancel_ effect not supported by redux-saga-test-plan integration tests
  - https://github.com/jfairbank/redux-saga-test-plan/issues/359
- Workaround in GitHub issue to wrap cancel in custom function
  - Complicates production code ðŸ‘Ž
  - Skip that assertion here

redux-saga-test-plan Unit Tests

- General idea
  - propose a flow
  - test fails if flow is not possible
- Less flexible / forgibing than intergration tests
- _next()_ moves the saga along
  - argument to _next()_ is value yielded from previous effect
- Need to create a mock task for fork / cancel

### 36. Code Quiz! Unit Tests

Unlike Integration Test, \
Unit test cannot chagne the order of sagas

### 37. Review: Fork, Cancel, Infinite while Loop

- Argument to _run()_ (timeout in milliseconds) to stop infinite loop
  - use _silentRun()_ to suppress warnings
- _sleep()_ helper function to make task run long enough to cancel
- _cancel_ effect not supported by integration tests (yet)
- unit tests
  - propose a flow
  - error if flow is not possible
- I prefer integration tests
  - unit tests are best if order is crucial
  - or if integration tests aren't possible

## 38. Getting Help with Saga Tests

If I got stuck during testing redux saga,\
create a repo and write a question in Q&A.

## Section 5: Testing Library Custom render: Redux and React Router

### 41. Custom render Concepts

#### Custom render for Providers

- Redux and React Router both have Providers that components need
  - Redux: provides store
  - React Router: provides history and location details
- Don't wrap with Providers -> errors
- Wrap with these Providers for every _render_ function?
  - tedious and repititive
- Solution:
  - create custom _render_ function that includes providers
  - add options to _render_ options object for initial state and router history

#### Decisions for Testing Redux

1. Put Provider in App, render App for all tests
   - Pros:
     - closer to production code
     - simpler test setup (only render App, no Provider wrap)
   - Cons:
     - No control over initial state
     - Can't render child components (they will be sad and provider-less, and throw errors)
2. **Wrap components in Provider with test store**
   - Pros:
     - can specify initial state
     - can render child components
   - Cons:
     - more complicated test setup
       - Provider needs a store
       - need to make a new one for each test
     - farther from production code
     - will use same function to create store

Winner: Wrap components. Faster, more tarted tests

### 42. Planning Custom render with Test Store

- Each test needs its own store (no overlap)
- Store should be close as possible to production store
- Testing Library: _render (ui, options)_
- The plan: write custom _render_ method to
  - create store using function from app/store/index.ts
  - add _initialState_ to options
  - wrap _ui_ in Redux provider with store containing specified _initialState_
  - run default Testing Library _render_ on wrapped _ui_ and return result
- test-utils/index.ts file exports \* from @testing-library/react
  - then overwrite default _render_ with custom _render_
- import from test-utils instead of @testing-library/react
- Eventually wrap in test Router as well
- Redux Provider and Router for production in src/index.tsx
  - instead of App.tsx
  - better control in testing
- Code adapted from Redux testing docs:
  - https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests#components
  - which are based on testing library docs: https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup#custom-render

### 45. Adding React Router to Custom render

- Adding Router to custom render: https://testing-library.com/docs/example-react-router/
- Create history using createMemoryHistory pass to test Router provider
  - [memory](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md#creatememoryhistory)
  - _memoryHistory_: history independent of browser
  - analogous to setting up test store for Redux
- Add two more properties to _render_ options
  - _routeHistory_: Array of routes (string)
  - _initialRouteIndex_: where in the history to start
    - default to last index of _routeHistory_
- Eventually: make history accessible to tests for assertions

#### import sorting

```sh
npm i eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort
# and set up the eslint rule
```

### 46. Asserting on history Object

Implementation Details?

- Is this testing implementation details?
- Relying on the structure of the history object
- Alternate plan:
  - render App with initial route set to /profile
  - check actual text on page
- Which is better?
  - Testing code vs testing behavior
  - User tradeoff:
    - implementation details test is more targeted / more isolated,
    - also doesn't test user experience
- Will demonstrate behavior test in the next lecture (optional)

### 48. Code Quiz! history.push()

- Effect is the same as _<Redicrect />_ so same test approach applies
- Test NavBar push to _/signin_ on Sign in button push
  - only _history.push_ instance that doesn't need fake server data
- Test that clicking sign in button loads "/signin" url and page when user is _null_
- Think about what to pass as options to custom render
  - If any!
- Try both styles of testing: unit testing and behavior testing
- Write tests in src/app/component/nav/NavBar.test.tsx
- Resist th urge to copy/paste!

### 49. OPTIONAL: Redux State Code Quiz

- Redux state tests for NavBar:
  - "sign in" button when user is falsy
  - "sign out" button and user email when user is truthy
- Behaviour tests (look for elements on the page)

### 50. Custom router Summary

- Choises and tradeoffs:
  - providers in App, render App for all tests
    - closer to user experience
    - less control over tests
  - providers in index.tsx, render components in tests
    - opposite of above
  - Wrap _ui_ in providers for custom render
    - test _store_ for Redux
    - test history (_memoryHistory_) for Router
  - App "setup" properties to _render_ options object
  - Return _history_ with _render_ return object
  - Export * from @testing-library/react, overwrite with custom *render\*
  - import from test-utils instead of @testing-library/react
